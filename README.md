# PokemonPrediction ðŸ§ 

Machine learning model to predict the rarity of pokemons using Python and multiple logistic regression.

## Data cleaning ðŸ“Š

The original dataset has twelve independet variables: **Pokedex Number, Name, Type 1, Type 2, Total Stats, HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed, Generation** and one output: **Legendary**.

|#  |Name                     |Type 1  |Type 2  |Total|HP |Attack|Defense|Sp. Atk|Sp. Def|Speed|Generation|Legendary|
|---|-------------------------|--------|--------|-----|---|------|-------|-------|-------|-----|----------|---------|
|1  |Bulbasaur                |Grass   |Poison  |318  |45 |49    |49     |65     |65     |45   |1         |False    |
|2  |Ivysaur                  |Grass   |Poison  |405  |60 |62    |63     |80     |80     |60   |1         |False    |
|3  |Venusaur                 |Grass   |Poison  |525  |80 |82    |83     |100    |100    |80   |1         |False    |
|3  |VenusaurMega Venusaur    |Grass   |Poison  |625  |80 |100   |123    |122    |120    |80   |1         |False    |

For this model, the variables **Pokedex Number, Name, Type 2, Total** and **Generation** will be ignored, since they are don't affect the final output.
**Type 1** is a dummy variable, hence the model does his treatment, by One-Hot Encoding them.

After this, since we will be using **gradient descent** to perform our training, the **data normalization** should be done, to avoid extra cost in the training algorithm.

And know the data is ready to be used, it just needs to be separated between the training and testing dataset, what can be done using **sklearn** function `train_test_split`.
